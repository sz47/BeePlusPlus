# BeePlusPlus
C++ but all variable names are the whole bee movie script

This repo contains the solution to the problem [Tree Recovery](https://codeforces.com/contest/1696/problem/F). This [solution](https://codeforces.com/contest/1696/submission/161791355) was originally written by [Tourist](https://codeforces.com/profile/tourist) and I've just change the variable names to the script of the bee movie. :)

The script was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/MattIPv4/045239bc27b16b2bcf7a3a9a4648c08a)
